      "story_title": "The elephant rope",
      "story_description": "Summary: \"The Elephant Rope\" is a short story about a young man who sees elephants at a circus. He's surprised that they stay in place with just a rope tied to a stake, even though they're big and strong. The elephants could break free but don't because they think they can't.\n\nTheme: \"The Elephant Rope\" is about believing in limits. The young man finds out that the elephants were taught when they were young that they couldn't break the rope. So, even as adults, they never try to break free.\n\nMoral of the story: Our beliefs can stop us from doing great things. Sometimes, we think we can't do something because of what we've been taught or experienced. But if we challenge ourselves and believe we can, we might surprise ourselves with what we can achieve."
