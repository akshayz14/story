      "story_description": "1. NASA Changed an Asteroid’s Orbit : \nIs there a way for humans to prevent a killer asteroid from striking earth? In the 1998 film Armageddon, NASA sent a group of oil drillers to space so that they could destroy it with a nuclear bomb. While that scenario is Hollywood fiction at its finest, real NASA experts successfully used a spacecraft this year to alter an asteroid’s orbit. Known as Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), the vending machine-sized craft collided with the asteroid at about 14,000 miles per hour. No word yet on whether or not the DART was piloted by Bruce Willis.\n\n 2. Ancient People in Utah Used Tobacco : \nFour tobacco seeds were discovered at an ancient campsite along what is referred to as the Old River Bed in Utah’s West Desert. While the words “river” and “desert” don’t often go together, this river flowed through the area between 13,000 and 9,500 years ago, when the terrain was much different. The Indigenous people who camped along the river apparently smoked or chewed the tobacco, as the seeds were burnt and there were no tobacco leaves present at the site. If the tobacco seeds are indeed from the same time period as the nearby plant material (dated to 12,300 years ago), they could be the oldest evidence of tobacco use that has ever been uncovered.\n\n3. Baby Woolly Mammoth Found After 30,000 Years : \nGold miners in Canada uncovered an unexpected treasure in the permafrost this past summer. While digging into a wall of frozen dirt, they inadvertently dislodged the remains of a baby woolly mammoth. Realizing the significance of the find, the crew ceased work and called government authorities. Once recovered, the mammoth has been studied intently. Thought to have been one month old at the time of her death, the remarkably preserved mammoth still has skin, fur, and toenails. She has even been blessed and named by Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in elders, the Yukon First Nation that calls the Yukon home. The name they chose for her was “Nun cho ga,” meaning “big baby animal.”\n\n4. More El Niño Means More Trouble for Marine Ecosystems: \nYou’ve likely heard of the El Niño phase of the global climate phenomenon known as El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). It’s so famous that it even cameoed on Saturday Night Live back in the ‘90s. But El Niño isn’t all fun and games. Known for bringing warmer surface temperatures to the eastern Pacific, El Niño is linked to droughts, floods, and overall disruption to marine ecosystems. To get a broader understanding of how our world could be impacted by an increasingly El Niño-dominated world, a team of researchers led by the University of Utah analyzed the climate phenomenon’s impact on animal communities over the past 12,000 years. The bottom line: when five or more El Niño events occur within a century, marine species struggle mightily while land-based species are more productive.\n\n5. There are Two Different Speeds of Sound on Mars : \nThe Perseverance rover is uncovering all kinds of fascinating things during its mission to Mars. Earlier this year, scientists used the rover’s onboard microphones to measure the speed of sound on the Red Planet. It turns out that sounds moves at one of two speeds (both more sluggish than the speed of sound here on earth) depending on the pitch. At 240 hertz and above, sound travels at 250 meters per second. Drop below 240 hertz, and the speed slows to 240 meters per second."

      "story_description": "1. Brain Cells Play Pong : \nResearchers in Australia have grown roughly 800,000 brain cells in a lab and linked them to a computer loaded with the vintage game Pong. Amazingly, these “mini-brains” have begun to sense the movement of the ball and can now control the paddle to guide the ball. In a local twist, Pong was developed back in the 1970s by Utah native Nolan Bushnell.\n\n2. Pluto has Ice Volcanoes : \nScientists have identified some amazing features as they analyze the images of Pluto captured by NASA’s New Horizons space probe. For example, they recently noticed some unique volcanoes. Rather than spewing magma, these fascinating formations likely produce an oozy mixture of substances such as water, ice, ammonia, or methane. It’s easier to imagine the presence of ice volcanoes when you remember that the average temperature on Pluto’s surface is minus 387 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n3. Ancient Footprints Found : \nFor only the second time in our nation’s history, human tracks from the Ice Age have been discovered by researchers. Dated back about 12,000 years, the footprints were created by both adults and children, giving us a better understanding of when these individuals came to North America. So where were the footprints found? Right here in our state, on the US Air Force Utah Test and Training Range in the West Desert.\n\n4. “Covert Consciousness” Exists During a Coma : \nResearch recently published in Scientific American revealed that up to 20% of patients who appear comatose are actually in a state of “covert consciousness.” While their bodies won’t respond to the outside world, their brains exhibit signs of awareness. This discovery has many implications, including the fact that some seemingly unconscious patients in an I.C.U. might be able to hear what doctors are saying about them.\n\n \b5. A New Treehopper with a Local Connection : \nLast but not least, let’s talk about treehoppers. These fascinating insects are found on every continent but Antarctica, but a newly discovered species has a special connection to Utah. Cladonota cryani, which makes its home in Bolivia, is named for NHMU Executive Director Jason Cryan. Distinguished by an appendage that looks like a broken twig, Cladonota cryani is a unique insect named for a true legend in the field."

      "story_description": "1. The Typewriter : \nThe typewriter, invented in the early 19th century, offered speed, efficiency and legibility. While the exact origins of the typewriter are unclear, Italian inventor Pellegrino Turri and later Christopher Latham Sholes played important roles in its development.\nThe invention also led to subsequent advancements, such as word processors and computers. Its influence is evident in the standard QWERTY keyboard, which remains widely used today on typewriters, smartphones and other devices. Despite debates about its efficiency, the QWERTY layout became dominant due to early adoption and the popularity of the Remington brand.\n\n2. Electromagnet : \nUnlike permanent magnets, electromagnets are temporary; their magnetic field only exists when the current is flowing through them. You can also control an electromagnet's strength by adjusting the current flow.\nThe ability to turn electromagnets on and off by completing or interrupting the circuit made them highly useful in industrial applications. During the Industrial Revolution, they were used in telegraph systems, electric generators and motors. Their ability to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy made them vital in the development of industrial machinery and automation.\n\n 3. Internal combustion engine : \n By harnessing controlled fuel explosions, the internal combustion engine converted energy into powerful mechanical motion, propelling vehicles and machinery with unprecedented efficiency. It became the primary power source for automobiles, airplanes, boats and various machines.\nThe engine's mechanics and components — such as the cylinder, piston, crankshaft, valves and spark plug — worked together to produce power. Most internal combustion engines used a four-stroke cycle (including intake, compression, combustion and exhaust strokes) to efficiently convert fuel into mechanical power.\nThe internal combustion engine replaced cumbersome steam engines with a portable and efficient power source, enabling unprecedented mobility and rapid transportation. It facilitated trade, expanded markets and contributed to urbanization. The invention's importance lies in its transformative effect on transportation and manufacturing.\n\n 4.

      "story_description": "1. Dynamite : \nInvented by Alfred Nobel in the late 19th century, dynamite revolutionized construction, mining and infrastructure projects by providing a safer and more efficient explosive. It enabled workers to excavate tunnels, break through hard materials like rock and concrete, and construct complex foundations with greater ease.\nHowever, dynamite also had controversial applications. It found use in the military, altering the nature of warfare and raising ethical concerns due to its destructive power. Debates about its responsible use and led Alfred Nobel to establish the Nobel Prizes as a way to recognize achievements in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and peace.\n\n2. Photograph : \n Numerous world-changing inventions came out of the Industrial Revolution. The camera wasn't one of them. In fact, the camera's predecessor, known as a camera obscura, had been hanging around for centuries, with portable versions coming along in the late 1500s.\nPreserving a camera's images, however, was a problem, unless you had the time to trace and paint them. Then along came Joseph Nicéphore Niépce. In the 1820s, the Frenchman had the idea to expose paper coated in light-sensitive chemicals to the image projected by the camera obscura. Eight hours later, the world had its first photograph.\nRealizing eight hours was an awfully long time to have to pose for a family portrait, Niépce began working with Louis Daguerre to improve his design, and it was Daguerre who continued Niépce's work after his death in 1833. Daguerre's not-so-cleverly-named daguerreotype generated enthusiasm first in the French parliament, and then throughout the world. But while the daguerreotype produced very detailed images, they couldn't be replicated.\nA contemporary of Daguerre's, William Henry Fox Talbot, was also working on improving photographic images throughout the 1830s and produced the first negative, through which light could be shined on photographic paper to create the positive image. Advancements like Talbot's came at a rapid pace, and cameras became capable of taking images of moving objects as exposure times dropped. In fact, a photo of a horse taken in 1877 was used to solve a long-standing debate over whether or not all four of a horse's feet left the ground during a full gallop (they did) [sources: International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum, Shah]. So the next time you pull out your smartphone to snap a picture, take a second to think of the centuries of innovation that made that picture possible.\n\n3. Steam locomotive : \n With the invention of the steam engine and subsequent development of the steam locomotive, the transport of goods and people became faster, more efficient and more reliable.\nRail networks expanded, connecting distant regions and enabling the transportation of raw materials to factories and finished products to markets. It revolutionized the textile industry by facilitating the movement of raw materials, such as coal and cotton, to manufacturing centers.\nThe steam locomotive also stimulated urbanization, as cities developed around railway hubs. Additionally, the increased speed and capacity of steam-powered transportation accelerated the growth of trade and commerce, fueling economic prosperity during the Industrial Revolution.\n\n "
