      "story_title": "Hare and tortoise",
      "story_description": "The Tortoise and the Hare is a classic fable attributed to Aesop, an ancient Greek storyteller. The story goes like this: \n\n Once upon a time, a hare (rabbit) boasted about how fast he could run. He was so confident in his speed that he challenged a tortoise (turtle) to a race. The tortoise, being much slower, accepted the challenge despite everyone knowing he was not as swift as the hare. \n\n On the day of the race, the hare sprinted ahead, leaving the tortoise far behind. Confident in his speed, the hare decided to take a nap under a tree midway through the race, believing he had plenty of time to catch up and win. \n\n Meanwhile, the tortoise continued plodding along steadily, never giving up despite his slow pace. As the hare slept, the tortoise eventually reached the finish line. \n\n When the hare woke up and realized what had happened, he raced to the finish line, but it was too late. The tortoise had already won the race. \n\n The moral of the story is often interpreted as 'slow and steady wins the race,' highlighting the importance of perseverance, consistency, and determination over relying solely on talent or speed."
