However, when Gaston finally reached the castle and threatened the Beast, Belle intervened, pleading for peace and understanding.\n\nIn a climactic moment, Gaston's jealousy and aggression led to his downfall. The Beast, having found true love and redemption in Belle's compassion, was transformed back into a prince by the power of their love.\n\nWith the curse broken and the castle restored to its former glory, Belle and the prince were married in a joyous celebration. The enchanted objects regained their human forms, and the kingdom rejoiced at the happy ending.\n\nThe story of Beauty and the Beast is a timeless tale of love, acceptance, and the transformative power of compassion.
